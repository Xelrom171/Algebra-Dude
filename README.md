I originally intended this to be a short simple game site for school that took around 20 minutes but I was bored and ended up working on this for hours it has a simple UI (with secret pages)
and minimal styling. It has an effective about:blank cloaker that also hides the site in your history. This site can easily be copied and deployed because all games are just single files.
